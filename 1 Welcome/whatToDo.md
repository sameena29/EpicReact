## What To Do!!

- Watch the videos one by one
- Open the excercises on local host
- Also open the excercise folder from the cloned repo
- Make changes and add stuff to those files inside excercise according to whatever is necessary
- Then go to test folder and import only from excercise and not final
- Run the test to see if the changes u have made are correct or not
  -So final folder is basically the solution
